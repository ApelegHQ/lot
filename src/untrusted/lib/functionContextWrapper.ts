/**
 * Wraps the provided script string with security enhancements to mitigate
 * potential malicious behaviours during its dynamic evaluation. This function
 * leverages a series of techniques to ensure the user script is sandboxed:
 *
 * - **`with` Statement**: Reduces the user script's scope, preventing it from
 * accessing the global scope directly.
 * - **'use strict' Mode**: Enforces stricter parsing and error handling on the
 * wrapped code, as well as limiting access to the real global scope via the
 * `this` keyword.
 *
 * @param script - The raw user-provided script to be wrapped.
 * @param preamble - Additional code to execute before the user-provided script
 * @returns The script wrapped with security enhancements.
