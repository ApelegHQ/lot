/**
 * Creates either a revocable or non-revocable Proxy based on the value of

 *
 * When `revocable` is true, a standard revocable Proxy is created using
 * `Proxy.revocable()`.
 * If `revocable` is false or not provided, a regular object is constructed.
 * If `revocable` is `null`, the first argument from `args` is returned as
 * the `proxy` without modification.
 *
 * @param revocable - Determines the type of Proxy to create.
 * @param args - Arguments to pass to the Proxy or custom Proxy constructor.
 * @returns An object containing the Proxy and a revoke function, mimicking the
 * structure returned by `Proxy.revocable`.
