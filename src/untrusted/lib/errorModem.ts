/* General note about this file:

Since most communication happens through the MessagePort interface, these
functions are technically not needed. However, in practice it is, because
`structuredClone` doesn't work as it should.

  - On Firefox, `structuredClone(Error())` results in a DOMException
    (DataCloneError)
  - On Node.js, `try { structuredClone(structuredClone) } catch (e) {
    structuredClone(e) }` incorrectly results in an empty object (instead of
    cloning a DataCloneError).

 * extracts the 'name', 'message', and 'stack' properties and returns them as
 * an array of strings.
 * 3. If the input includes a 'cause' property and the depth of extraction is
 * within limits, the function recursively extracts information from the cause

 * 4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns the string

 *
 * @param e - The input value, possibly an error object, from which information
 * will be extracted.
 * @param depth - Optional. The current depth of extraction, used for recursive
 * cause extraction. If not specified or if within the maximum depth limit
 * (MAX_DEPTH), the extraction will include nested cause information.
 * @returns The extracted error information, possibly including an array of
 * strings for the 'name', 'message', and 'stack' properties, along with
 * recursively extracted cause information. If the input does not match known

 * object or a specific error class from the information.
 *
 * 1. If the input is an array of length 3 or 4, and the third element is a
 * string, the function attempts to reconstruct the error.
 * 2. The function looks for a global error class matching the provided name,
 * and falls back to the generic Error class if none is found.
 * 3. It assigns the 'name', 'message', and 'stack' properties from the input
 * array, and may recursively assign a 'cause' property if depth is within
 * limits (MAX_DEPTH).
 * 4. If the reconstruction conditions are not met, the input is returned as-is.
 *
 * @param d - The input information, potentially an array containing 'name',
 * 'message', 'stack', and optionally 'cause' values.
 * @param depth - Optional. The current depth of reconstruction, used for
 * recursive cause reconstruction. If not specified or if within the maximum
 * depth limit (MAX_DEPTH), the reconstruction will include nested cause
 * information.
 * @returns The reconstructed Error object, or the unmodified input if the
