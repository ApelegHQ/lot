/**
 * Wraps the given postMessage function to provide error handling.
 *
 * This wrapper attempts ensures that messages are sent successfully, despite
 * errors when sending a message. If an error occurs during message sending,
 * it tries to send an error message with detailed information.
 * If that fails, it sends a generic error message. If even that fails, it does
 * nothing and the error is silently caught. This function is meant to be used
 * for returning the result of running tasks (when communicating across
 * realms). For task requests, having sending a message fail does not require
 * special handling, as the error is delivered locally.
 *
 * @param postMessage - The original postMessage function.
 * @returns A wrapped postMessage function with error handling.
 *
 * @example
 * const wrappedPostMessage = postMessageWrapper(originalPostMessage);
 * wrappedPostMessage(["DATA", "Some Data"]);
