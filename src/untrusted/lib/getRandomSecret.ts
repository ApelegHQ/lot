/**
 * Converts a given buffer into a Base16 string (using a custom logic)
 *
 * The conversion is not a standard hexadecimal conversion. It performs specific
 * bitwise operations and character code translations, including:
 *
 * 1. Right shifting the value 4 bits and masking it with 0x0f, then OR'ing it
 * with 0x40.
 * 2. Right shifting the value 0 bits (leaving it unchanged) and masking it with
 * 0x0f, then OR'ing it with 0x40.
 * 3. Adding 1 to both of these values and converting them to ASCII characters.
 *
 * This gives a string with values in the range A-P. This range was chosen
 * because it is an acceptable range for most places and because of the ease
 * of calculation.
 *
 * @param buffer - The buffer that will be converted to a string
 * @returns The string representation of the buffer using the custom logic.
