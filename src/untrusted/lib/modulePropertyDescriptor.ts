/**
 * A property descriptor that defines properties for a CommonJS-like module
 * object.
 *
 * This descriptor is structured to support the `module.exports` pattern,
 * commonly found in CommonJS module systems. The `exports` property within
 * allows the assignment of exported values, separating internal logic
 * from what is shared or exported to other modules.
 *
 * @property value - An object representing the main property attributes.
 * @property value.exports - An object created with a null prototype to store
 * exported values.
 * @property value.exports.value - The value to be exported, initially an empty
 * object.
 * @property value.exports.writable - Indicates if the `exports` property can be
 * changed.
 * @property value.exports.enumerable - Makes the `exports` property show up
 * during enumeration.
 * @property value.exports.configurable - Indicates if the property can be
 * deleted or changed.
